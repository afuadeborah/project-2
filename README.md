# Accelerated JavaScript Final Project: Raptors Game Night
Final project for Juno College Accelerated JavaScript course (October 2019). Raptors Game Night experience.
\\Hello welcome!

This project is a Toronto Raptors-themed game night experience site for my second project at Juno College. If you venture over into the script.js file, you'll find the code I found the most challenging during this project but am the most proud of!

The tone of this site is very "Toronto man", so please have a laugh!

Thank you for stopping by!
